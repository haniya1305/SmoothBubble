# SmoothBubble

In this study, participants will use two cursor types—the Bubble Cursor and the Bubble Cursor with 1 Euro Filter smoothing—to complete a series of target selection tasks. Each trial begins with the cursor reset to the bottom-left corner of the screen, ensuring a consistent starting position. The target will appear at a random angle but at a fixed distance from this starting point, so the distance to the target remains constant across all trials. We will start with the bubble cursor trials and then do the 1 euro filter trials. For each trial, we’ll track the time it takes for participants to move from the starting position to the target and select it, enabling us to analyze differences in speed and accuracy across the two cursor types
